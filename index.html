    <section id="context" class="background">
        <h1 class="context-head">Context</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p >The main purpose of this project is to look at the difference between two interfaces where the only difference is a small change 
                to compare the old version (i.e., Version A) while the altered version (i.e., Version B). The task for this particular project was the following: 
            </p>
            <div class="task-contain">
                <button class="task-button">Schedule an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024</button>

            </div>
            <p>Therefore, the main overarching question that we want to answer in this project is whether or not the change that we made in Version B will 
                lead to a statistically significant difference in certain metrics that we can measure in users. A/B allows us to test if certain designs 
                have positive/negative effects because if there is no statistically significant difference, then that means that the change in Version B 
                is irrelevant/unnecessary. However, if a change is statistically significant, then that means that this change could positively affect the 
                overall usability of the interface. Therefore, in this project, we will explore if such a small change will have a great impact on certain metrics 
                that we will collect, test, and measure.

                The name of the website that we are trying to improve the design of is called MEDx, an all-inclusive interface where you can schedule and see appointments 
                with nearby doctors, take care of payments and prescriptions, and much more. However, as stated in the context section above, our main task is to schedule
                 an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024. Therefore, to assist with this task, the small change that I made was to change 
                 the color of the button to press to a dark blue color to try to indicate to the user that this is the button to click as it is the only button to press. The 
                 differences in Version A and Version B are noted below. 
            </p>

    </div>
    <div class="context-paragraph">
        <p>
            As you can see, the button that you need to press to complete the task is shaded in a dark blue color in Version B while the rest 
            of the buttons are greyed out to make the user shy away from clicking those buttons. This is the only change that I made from Version A to 
            Version B.

            <p class="p2-response">Now, that I've collected our own data and participated in testing my classmates' designs in studio, we will 
                now create null and alternative hypotheses for each of the following three data types: 
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <!-- MISCLICK RATE  -->

                    <span class="underline">Misclick Rate</span>: the frequency with which users click something else on the page before finding the correct button for the task

                            <span class="underline">Null Hypothesis</span>: On average, Version B will have the same misclick rate when compared with Version A. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="underline">Prediction</span>: I predict that I will end up rejecting this null hypothesis. The reason why is that in Version B, I specifically 
                            colored-in the button that needs to be clicked on to complete the task, so I predict that will limit the number of times that a user
                            would click on an incorrect portion of the interface as they would naturally gravitate towards the only button that is colored-in. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="underline">Alternative Hypothesis</span>: On average, Version B will have a smaller misclick rate when compared with Version A. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="underline">Reasoning</span>: The reasoning behind my alternative hypothesis is that in Version B, since I colored-in the button 
                            that needs to be pressed to complete the task, this would lower the chance that a user clicks on a different part of the interface. This means 
                            that the misclick rate should be smaller than that of Version A as fewer incorrect clicks are made. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <!-- TIME ON PAGE -->
                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Time on Page</span>: time spent on the webpage for each user group
                    <ul class="sub-bullet">
                        <li>
                            <span class="underline">Null Hypothesis</span>: On average, Version B will have the same time on page when compared to Version A.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="underline">Prediction</span>: I predict that I will end up rejecting the null hypothesis. The reason for this is because due to the change that I made, the 
                            users will spend less time misclicking and hesitating to complete the task. This means that the overall time spent on the webpage will decrease leading to us rejecting the null hypothesis.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="underline">Alternative Hypothesis</span>: On average, Version B will have a lower time on page when compared to Version A. 
                        </li>

                            <span class="underline">Reasoning</span>: The reasoning behind my alternative hypothesis is that due to the change made in Version B, people will 
                            misclick less which leads to a fast completion of the task which leads to a lower time spent on the webpage. Therefore, that's why I conclude that people will spend more 
                            time on Version A when compared to Version B. 
                        </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="underline">Did Succeed</span>: a metric of our own choosing! The specific method that I chose was <span class="italicize">did_succeed</span> which is a boolean
                    flag that checks to see if the user has successfully completed the task. 
                    <ul class="sub-bullet">
                        <li>
                            <span class="underline">Null Hypothesis</span>: The proportion of users who successfully complete the task in Version B is the same as the proportion of users 
                            who successfully complete the task in Version A. 
                        </li>

                            <span class="underline">Prediction</span>: I predic that I will fail to reject the null hypothesis. The reason for this is that the purpose of A/B testing is not 
                            to necessarily improve the proportion of success, but rather, to make the experience more seamless for the user. Since in Version A, we randomly tested until someone 
                            was able to complete the task, I predict that there won't be differences in this metric. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="underline">Alternative Hypothesis</span>: The proportion of users who successfully complete the task in Version B is greater than the proportion of 
                            users who successfully complete the task in Version A. 
                        </li>

                            <span class="underline">Reasoning</span>: The reason why I chose this altenrative hypothesis is because due to the improvement made in Version B, it is hard 
                            to see the proportion of success go down, meaning that it makes sense for an alternative hypothesis to show a greater proprotion in Version B.

            <p class="p3-response">For this part, using all of the sketches, lo-fi wireframes, and hi-fi prototypes that I created before, I redesigned Grandma's Country Kitchen 
                using HTML/CSS. While it isn't fully interactive, the main overall design and layout of the website is included. Additionally, 
                it's important to note that the final design wasn't exactly the same as the final mockup which can happen in the development phase, but for the most part, 
                the final redesign reflects the hifi-prototypes. Additionally, when testing accessibility, I have the following screenshot of the

                While there is just one contrast error due to the "see menu" button, for the most part, there aren't any major errors detected. Additionally, to try to make
